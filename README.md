# 17euec117_Key-Value-DataStore
This is a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete) operations. This data store is meant for using as a local storage for one single process on one laptop. The data store is being exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work with the data store.
